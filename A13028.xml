            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

From whence it followeth that the gouerment of the church, by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Suffraganes, Archdeacons, Deacons, Chancelours, Commiſſaries and Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, now already planted and liked of, was not practiſed by the Apoſtles, and primitiue Church. And therefore for my part, I can not, but marueile, that a diſciple of the Apoſtles doctrine, and a ſucceſſor in the Apoſtles Chayre, ſhould bee drawne by humane reaſons, not to like of the Apoſtles gouerment, nor to tread in the ſteps of the primitiue
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:177772:4"/> church. For ſeeing the ſame is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by himſelfe to bee the firſt way, to be the old and ancient way, as being the Apoſtles way, why ſhould wee not <note place="margin">Iere. 6. 16.</note> walke therein, as in the onelie good and perfect way? The reuerend Biſhops will not deny, that the Apoſtles, and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church for their manner of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had the mind of Chriſt, and that we ſhould follow the Apoſtles, as hauing them for examples, becauſe they were the followers of Chriſt. Againe they can not but graunt, that the manner of gouerment, practiſed by the Apoſtles &amp; primitiue church, is written within the booke of the couenants of grace. All which notwithſtanding wee ſee in this place that from the new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, from the articles of grace, from the law, from the teſtimony, from the example of the Apoſtles, and from the mind of Chriſt, we are addreſſed and turned ouer to our ſtate of gouerment, to our countrey, to our people, to our common weale, and to our lawes. But this turning of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes ſhall it not be eſteemed, as the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">Iſaiah. 29 16.</note> clay?</p>
                  <p>But (ſaith he) to plant thoſe things in this church, which are required to bee
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:177772:4"/> redreſſed, might bring rather the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Goſpell, then the end, that is deſired. Indeed (ſay I) if this might be as ſoone proued, as it was ſoone ſaid, the caſe might haue gone well with him. But this parable is ſo darke, that (vnleſſe it be opened) there is no light at all to be ſeene in it. For hee well knew, that in ſteed of the gouerment practiſed by the Apoſtles and primitiue church, the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraganes, Deacons, Archdeacons, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celours, Commiſſaries and Officials, is already planted in this church: And he was not ignorant alſo that the ſame iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction onely, and none other, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be redreſſed. Now then if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt be made, that this manner of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment bee redreſſed, how can it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently be ſeene that to plant that maner of gouerment, might bring rather the ouerthrowe of the Goſpell, then the end that is deſired? But it may be that hee ment more lightſomely then he ſpake. Yea let it be, that he intended thus: <hi>viz.</hi> to vnplant that, which is now planted, and to plant thoſe things, which are yet vnplanted (by reaſon of many and great alterations) might bring rather an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:177772:5"/> of the Goſpell, then the end that is deſired; well (I ſay) be it ſo, that he thus ment. How is this thing euidently ſeene, or how can it euidently be proued? The beſt ſight, that the ſeruant of Chriſt can haue, is faith. For Faith is an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thinges which are not ſeene. <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> This ouerthrow then of the Goſpell, not being ſeene with his bodily eyes, muſt needes be intended to haue bene ſeene with the eyes of his faith. But where is that word of Chriſt, wherevpon the eyes of his faith were fixed? If then hee hold no word of faith, then of neceſſitie was his euident ſight, but an euident fancie. And in deed what elſe could it be? For what other thing is there deſired, to bee planted in this church, but onely the Apoſtolicall gouernement of Chriſt? And what other Goſpell could hee eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſee, that might bee ouerthrowne by holding foorth this ſcepter, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the Apoſtolicall doctrine of Chriſt? A merveylous ſtrange and vnkind ſight, (I trow) to be ſeene, that the Apoſtolicall gouerment could no ſooner be planted, but that the Apoſtolicall doctrine muſt needs be rooted vp. That Chriſt by his owne ſcepter, were not able to maintaine
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:177772:5"/> his own grace, by his own order, ſhould weaken his owne oath, or by his owne ſword, ſhould cut from the people of God, his owne word. But ſeeing it was his purpoſe to perſwade the people vnto a diſlike of the Apoſtolicall gouerment, by arguments and reaſons drawen from humane policie, rather then to confirme them in a good opinion of the prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call gouerment, by proofes taken from the authoritie of holy Scripture, we will follow him in this his veine. Yea, and by the helpe of God, we will trie of what efficacie, ſuch his politicke and humane reaſons may be, as wherewith he did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaye, to diſſwade the people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto any other maner of Church gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then is already ſetled among vs. The generall effect of all which, both here and els where ſpoken of, by him brieflie gathered, is this:

For ſithence both here, and throughout his booke, his intent was to diſpute for the gouerment already receiued, againſt the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:177772:6"/> gouerment, which is required, to be planted, in the Church: And for ſo much alſo, as none other gouerment, is required to bee planted, but that onely gouerment, which was practiſed, by the Apoſtles and primitiue Church, it muſt neceſſarilie follow, that the arrowes, which hee ſhott againſt the gouerment, required to be planted, were ſhott onely againſt the gouerment which was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the Apoſtles, and primitiue Church. And therefore there can bee no iuſt charge of any falſification, vſed in the gathering of his arguments. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which I argue as followeth:
<q>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Whatſoeuer will draw with it no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the ſtate of gouerment, &amp; but few, or ſmall alterations of the lawes, the ſame may rather bring the end, that is deſired,</hi> viz: <hi>a godlie peace, and Christian vnitie both in Church and common weale, then the ouerthrow of the Goſpell among vs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But the planting of the gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the Apoſtles and primitiue Church, will draw with it no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the ſtate of gouerment, and but few or ſmall alterations of the lawes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:177772:7"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore the planting of the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment practiſed by the Apostles, &amp; primitiue Church, may rather bring the end that is deſired,</hi> viz: <hi>a godlie peace and christian vnitie, both in church and common weale, then the overthrow of the Goſpell among vs.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The trueth of which argument will the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appeare, when the Admonitors argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhalbe conuinced of errour: for the diſproofe of the one, is the proofe of the other, and if his fall, then can not this but follow. And touching the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity of the firſt propoſition, of his ſecond ſillogiſme, we affirme, that the alterations, of the ſtate of gouerment, &amp; of the lawes (bee they neuer ſo many and neuer ſo great) can neuer bring any ouerthrowe of the Goſpell, if the ſame alterations, be made, for the planting of the Goſpell. For the lawes once altered, can ouerthrow naught, becauſe they are then no more lawes. And to ſay, that the Goſpell once planted by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of new lawes, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ouerthrowne by the ſame lawes, is more abſurd. For the new lawes giue life to the enterteyning of the Goſpell, by meanes whereof, the Goſpell, can not diſcontinue, ſo long as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:177772:7"/> thoſe lawes continue. And herevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo it followeth, that no alteration of laws, for ſweeping, &amp; clenſing of the Church, for caſting, and whippyng buiers and ſellers, and choppers of churches, out of the Church, can ouerthrow the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. For if all droſſe, filth, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be caſt out; if all lets, and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, be done a way, it can not be but that the Goſpell, muſt needs haue a freer, &amp; larger paſſage, as wherunto, a wider doore can not be, but opened, for the bringing in of a more plentiful harueſt. And if the Church bee beautifull as Tyrſa, and comely as Ieruſalem, if ſhe <note place="margin">Solo.

Belike he knew ſome to faine, that our ſtate of gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily fancy, whatſoeuer they fancy. And namely that a reformation of the Church, can not but infer a deſolation of the State: or that the State can not be well ordered, except it ſuffer the Church to bee diſordered, or that the Church could not be fayre, well fauoured, and

And alas what a reſolution was that among pillers and Fathers (for ſo they

Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, when as the things required to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, were required to be redreſſed at the hands of the whole ſtate of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is at the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the Queene, the Lords ſpirituall and temporall, and commons in open Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t aſſembled. And could any damage (I pray you) haue enſued to the ſtate of gouerment, to the ſtate of the Queene, to the ſtate of our countrey, people, common weale, &amp; lawes, or to the ſtate of the Goſpell, if things amiſſe in the Church, had bene redreſſed, and thinges wanting in the Church, had bene planted, by ſo high, and ſupreame a power? I trow not. Nay ſeeing our country, people, and commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale, not only once, and twiſe, &amp; thriſe, but many times, haue humbly and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtlie prayed, &amp; ſollicited in open Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, a redreſſe of things amiſſe in the church, is it not moſt evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that things were not conſidered a right but amiſſe by theſe fathers of the church? and that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderers by keeping things vnpla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The reaſon of all which his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, he yeeldeth to be this: namely, that the Author ought to haue proved them, not to haue ben repugnant to the cuſtomes of the Realme, but to haue bin in vſe and practiſe before the making of that acte of ſubmiſſion. For hee muſt proue (ſayth the Anſwerer) that they are not repugnant to the cuſtomes of this Realme, and ſhew vs how they haue bin vſed and executed heere, before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the ſtatute: yea he can ſay, that they are by lawe eſtabliſhed among vs. Which points (ſaith he) becauſe we learn by law, <hi>quod facta no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preſumantur,</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in fact, are not intended to be done, vntill they bee proued ſo: we muſt ſtill put him to his proofes, &amp; in the meane time ſay, that hee hath gaped wide to ſay nothing to the purpoſe, and that in his whole booke, he hath talked, but not reaſoned.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:177772:24"/> alone to bee forbidden; and civill gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment to be vnlawfull in eccleſiaſtical perſons, then much more forcibly may this argument be retorted, vpon all ſuch as clayme, alleage &amp; put in vre any por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the forraigne canon law.

Moreover becauſe it is not yet proved, that the forraigne and papall canon law is not contrariant nor repugnant to the lawes, ſtatutes or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the Realme, nor derogatorie to the prerogatiues of the regall Crown; nay becauſe the contradictorie hereof is affirmed, and this denied: and becauſe we learne by law (as he ſaith) that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in fact, are not intented to be done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:177772:25"/> the vpholders and executioners of this law, to their proofe, and in the meane while tell them that the forraign &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall law, is but a pretended neceſſary &amp; diſuſed law; that it is not inſpired with the life of law, and that it is fathered by them to be ſuch a law, as is an hedleſſe, a fetherleſſe and a nockleſſe arrow which is not fit to be drawn, or ſhot againſt any ſubiect of the King. And from this voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, abolition &amp; nullitie of forraigne and papall canon law (becauſe <hi>ſublato principali, tolluntur acceſſoria)</hi> it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that all offices and functions of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Archbiſhops, papall Biſhops, papall Suffraganes, papall Archdeacons, papall Deanes and Chapters, papall Prieſtes, papall Deacons, papall Subdeacons, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Chancelors, papall Vicars generall, papall Commiſſaries, and papall Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, meerely depending vpon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and drawen from the rules and grounds of that lawe, are likewiſe adni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated, and of no value.

Nowe by this Charter, if the ſame be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrued aright, there is proviſion made; firſt, that ſuch honour and worſhip bee yeelded by the King and his ſubictes, his and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors and poſteritie vnto God, as truely,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:177772:33"/> and in deed belongeth vnto him: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, that not onely ſuch rightes and liberties, as the King &amp; his progenitors, but alſo that ſuch as God had endowed the Church of England with, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably be preſerued. And in verie deed, to ſpeake truely &amp; properly, ſuch rights and liberties onely, are to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the rightes &amp; liberties of the church of England, which God him ſelfe hath giuen by his lawe vnto his vniuerſall Church, &amp; not which the Kings of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, by their Charter, haue bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed to the particular church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. When therefore queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made, that by the great Charter, the Kinges of England are bound to maintayne the rights and liberties of the Church of Englande, we are to enquire and ſearch what rights and liberties, God in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie word, hath granted vnto his vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church; and ſo by conſequence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of England, one part of the Catholike church.

For (ſaith the King) wee will with hazard of our life, and loſſe of our Crowne, vpholde and defend in our Realmes whatſoever wee ſhall know to be the will of God. The church of God then in England, not being free, nay ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her rights and liberties according to the great Charter, whole and vnhurt, but being in bondage and ſervitude to the Sea of Rome, contrarie to the lawe of God; the King iudged it to ſtande highlie with his honor, &amp; with his oath (according to the meaſure of knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which then was giuen vnto him) to reform, redreſſe, &amp; amend the abuſes of the ſame Sea. If then it might pleaſe our gratious Soveraigne Lord King <hi>IAMES,</hi> that now is (treading in the godly ſteppes of his renoumed great Vncle) to vouchſafe an aboliſhment of all lordlie primacie, executed by Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epiſcopal, &amp; Epiſcopall authoritie, over the Miniſters of Chriſt; His Highnes in ſo doing, could no more rightlie bee charged with the violation of the great Charter, then might King <hi>HENRY</hi> the eight with the baniſhment of the Popes

Nay if the Kings of England, by reaſon of their oath, had bin ſo ſtraightlie tied to the wordes of the great Charter, that they might not in anie ſort, haue diſannulled any ſuppoſed rightes, &amp; liberties of the church then vſed, and confirmed by the great Charter, vnto the church that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſuppoſed, to be the Church of God in England; then (belike) King Henrie the eight, might bee atteinted to haue gone againſt the great Charter, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his oath, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the overthrow of Abbayes &amp; Monaſteries, he tooke away the rightes, and liberties of the Abbotts and Priors. For by expreſſe wordes of the great Charter, Abbotts and Priors, had as ample and as large a Patent, for their rightes and liberties, as our Archb. &amp; Bb. can at this day chalenge for their primacies. If then the rightes and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the one, as being againſt the lawe of God, be duly &amp; lawfully taken away, notwithſtanding any matter, clauſe, or ſentence, conteyned in the great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;

And further we ſay, if there were none other vſe, nor end of the ſtudie of the civill lawe, then hope of reward, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by ſome office &amp; function of the canon lawe, that then Civilians ſhould in vaine ſeeke for knowledge in the civill lawe, becauſe without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, and by the only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſuch things, as are within the compaſſe of the canon law, they might reape that rewarde and maintenance. Nay, ſithens by experience wee haue known that ſome, who neuer vnclapſed the inſtitutions of <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> out of the ſame to learne the definition of civill iuſtice, haue bin &amp; yet are authorized,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:177772:36"/> to exerciſe the offices and functions of the canon law; how ſhould the ſtudie of the civill lawe, bee furthered by theſe offices and functions, when as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any knowledge of the civill law, theſe offices and functions haue bin and yet are dayly vndertaken, and executed to the full? And what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then (if there were none other rewarde for Civilians) would tenne or twelue yeres togither, beat his braine, and trouble his witts, in the ſtudie of the civill lawe, when every ſilly canoniſt might be able and learned inough, to ſit in the Biſhops throne, and to be iudge in his conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? Beſides, if the Admonitor ſpeake ſooth, viz: that Civilians in this Realm, liue not by the vſe of the civill lawe, to what end then ſhould he feare an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the ſtudie thereof? For if there be no vſe of it in this Realme, for the maintenance of this life, to what vſe then ſhould men ſtudie the ſame in this Realme? As for the vſe of it among ſtrangers, and forraigne nations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Realme; the ſame (as I ſuppoſe) is no greater then ſuch as 3. or 4. Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians may bee able well inough, fully to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:177772:37"/> deliver the law, touching all matters of controverſie, that may grow to queſtion during the whole ſpace of a Kinges raigne. If no man lived in this Realme by the trade of brewing Beere, but that all Brewers did live by the trade of brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ale, what ſhould we neede to feare the decaye of Beere-brewers, or what vſe were there of them? In like ſort, if men liue onelie by the vſe, offices and functions of the canon law, &amp; that men liue not (as he ſaith) by the vſe of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill law within the Realme, what follie were it to ſtudie the one, whereas with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge therof, he might live by the other? And therefore it ſeemeth that the Admonitor by his own weapon, as much as in him lay, hath given the whole ſtudie of the civill law, a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate and deadly wound. And to the end we may vnderſtand what reward &amp; maintenance, Civilians by the offices &amp; functions of the canon law, doe receyve yearely for their ſervice and attendance, in the Biſhops and Archdeacons their Courts; We will examine what fees Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the civil law, being Chancelors, Commiſſaries or Officials, haue vſually,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:177772:37"/> and ordinarily allowed vnto them, by their Lords and Maiſters. Fees for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat of Teſtaments, graunting of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, <note place="margin">Fees for pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bat of teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments let to farme.</note> with their appendances, of late yeares in ſome places (whether in all or how many I know not) haue bin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vnto farm for an annual rent; out of which, either a ſmall or no portion at all, hath bin allowed vnto the Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor or Official, for his ſervice in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. Wherevpon (as I coniecture) it hath fallen out, rather then that thoſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers would worke, keepe courts, &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile for litle, or nought, there have bin exacted greater fees, for the diſpatch of theſe things, then by law ought to haue bin paied. Perquiſits of courts, ariſing vpon ſuits, commenced betwene partie and partie, it muſt bee a plentifull har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, and there muſt be <hi>multi amici curiae</hi> in a Bb. conſiſtorie, if ordinarily <hi>(com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munibus annis)</hi> they amou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r in the whole to twentie pounds by the yeare: and yet theſe perquiſits, belong not wholy to the Chancelor, but are to be devided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him &amp; the Regiſter.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:177772:38"/> licences to preach, licences for Curates and Readers. For teſtimoniall of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, or licences to marrie without banes; fees for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mutation of penance, &amp; fees for relaxation of ſequeſtrations: touching theſe manner of Fees, if the ſame be fees no way warantable, howe are not then ſuch Fees every way diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable for a Doctor of the civill lawe, <note place="margin">Fees due for the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the canon lavve, diſhonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Doctor of the civil lavv</note> to take, either of Miniſters or people?

For if Fees for probat of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments, and granting of adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with their appendices, ſhall ſtill be let to farme; and if alſo, many vnlawfull Fees were quite inhibited, there would remaine (I trowe) but a very poore pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for Civilians out of the functions of the canon law, to maintaine their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoralities withall.

By all which it is evident, that the Clergie hath had the correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theſe crimes, rather by a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, &amp; by ſufferance of Princes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that they be meere ſpiritual, or that they had authoritie, by the immediate law of God.

For by cuſtome, and ſufferance onlie, ſome of theſe crimes be exempted from the cognizance of the King, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the immediate law of God, the cognizance as well of all, as of ſome

And then the iudgment, of thoſe men, who defend iudgements of adulterie, ſlaunder, &amp;c. to be more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and by the temporall Magiſtrate, onelie to be dealt in, ſeemeth every way, to bee a ſincere, and ſound iudgement. Howbeit, they doe not hereby intend, that the partie offending, in any of theſe things, &amp; by the Kings law puniſhable, ſhould therefore wholly be exempted &amp; freed from all cenſures of the Church.

                  <p>To this wee anſwere, that it is not againſt reaſon, that one man, for one <note place="margin">For a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be puniſhed twiſe for one fault in two reſpects is not vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</note> fault, ſhould bee puniſhed both tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porallie and ſpirituallie. Firſt he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of two parts: viz. of a bodie, and of a ſoule, in both which parts he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. Secondlie he hath offended, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginſt two lawes, the law of God, and the law of the King. For the execution of which two lawes, there be two kindes of officers, of two ſeverall natures, the King for the one lawe, and the Officers of the Church for the other law; &amp; both theſe kindes of officers, haue power given them, immediatlie from God, to execute the one, Kinglie and temporal; the other
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:177772:63"/> Paſtorall &amp; ſpirituall power. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſay, it ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth with great reaſon, that the ſoule cauſing the body to ſinne, ſhould no more eſcape that puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which is appointed for the ſoule, by the law of God, then the body ſhould eſcape that puniſhment which is appointed for the bodie, by the law of the King: why then the Officers of the Church, may medle with matters apperteyning to the Kinges law, &amp; what an indignitie to the King were that? To this we anſwere, that the Officers of the church, in a ſeverall reſpect, and to a ſeverall end, dealing in one, and the ſelfe ſame matter, wherein the King dealeth, may no more be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with dealing in matters appertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Crowne, by the exerciſe of their ſpirituall ſword, then can the King be charged, with medling in the ſame matters, to medle with matters pertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the ſoule, by the exerciſe of his temporall ſworde. So that the ſpirituall power of the officers of our Saviour Chriſt, (which conſiſteth onelie in bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and looſing of the ſoules of men) can not poſſiblie, by any reaſon or good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And if it be lawfullie appropried and ſo a lawfull poſſeſſion, and heritage, then I leaue it againe to the inquiſition of the King, what ſumme of money, out of the fontes of the ſame church ought yearlie to be diſtributed, to the poore Parochia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; what the endowment, of a Vicare cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicallie to be inſtituted, and inducted, in the ſame church, ſhould be: what houſe is appointed for the ſame Vicar to keepe his hoſpitalitie in, and whether any Vicare, for the ſpace of theſe many yeres paſſed, hath bin Canonicallie inſtituted, and inducted in the ſame church, to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:177772:66"/> that endowment, to inhabite that ſame houſe, and enforme that people. For if by the appropriation it ſelfe, or by the abuſe thereof, the poore Parochians, haue bin defrauded of their yearelie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution, or if no Vicares haue bene Canonicallie inſtituted and inducted in the ſame, or if being inducted, they haue their indowments ſo ſmall, or ſo cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſlie kept backe from them, as that they can not ſufficientlie mainteine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, much leſſe keepe hoſpitalitie: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as the Admonitor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth,) there muſt needes be a lamentable abuſe of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations; and that therefore it is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be wiſhed, that by ſome good ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, it might be remedied.</p>
                  <p>And as thoſe churches which are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully appropried, are not the lawfull poſſeſſion and heritage, of the proprieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſo on the other ſide we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>irme, that thoſe impropriations, which were made &amp; reformed, according to the ſtatutes of <hi>Ri.</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>He.</hi> 4. may well ſtand, as mens lawfull poſſeſſions and heritages, even with thoſe things, which are required to be planted &amp; brought into the Church, whatſoever the Admonitor hath written
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:177772:67"/> to the contrarie. For wee doe not holde that maintenance, muſt onlie and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarilie be provided for everie Miniſter, by the payment of tythes, oblations and other eccleſiaſticall profites, belonging to churches appropried, or diſappropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For there being no direct proofe, to be made out of the law of God, that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpell, muſt onelie liue vpon tythes; the King and Parleament, may well and competentlie inough, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point covenable endowments for everie Miniſter, without diſapproprying of any church appropried. And therefore litle cauſe had the Admonitor, to inſinuate the ruine of impropriations, vpon the bringing in, the diſcipline of our Savior Chriſt, becauſe the ſame may bee well planted, and yet to other not vnplanted. But what neede we to argue againſt his inſinuation, conſidering he him ſelfe, before he came to the end of this page, by his owne diſclayme, contradicted his inſinuation. For if <hi>the forme of finding Ministers by tythes, must with the canon law</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>be aboliſhed, and if there muſt be ſome other order for this deviſed, becauſe this may ſeeme papisticall and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:177772:67"/> Antichristian,</hi> what ſhould anie man feare the taking away of thoſe lawes, whereby impropriations do ſtand? For if ſuch <hi>as heretofore haue ſpoken or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten against them, becauſe</hi> (as he inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) <hi>the forme of finding Ministers by tythes, ſeemed to be vnlawfullie taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> and as he would alſo inſinuate by their iudgement, ought againe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and not to ſtande any longer as mens lawfull poſſeſſions and heritages. How (I ſaye) doth it followe that they which deſire impropriations, to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to their priſtinate ſtate, ſhould withall require, to haue the findinge of Miniſters by tythes, to bee aboliſhed? It ſeemeth therefore, that the Admonitor, ſo he might be talking, paſſed but a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>itle what he talked. For what a double talke is heere? or to what purpoſe was this talke? Was it becauſe ſome men do thinke, that the Miniſters, ought not to receyue tythes, for their reliefe, &amp; paynes in the Miniſterie? Why then, let all men knowe, that we diſclayme ſuch ſome mens opinions. For wee accompt all things, perteyning to this lyfe, directlie, or by conſequence, not commaunded,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:177772:68"/> nor prohibited, by the holy and ſacred Scriptures, to be things indifferent, and that therefore we may vſe them, or not vſe them, as the commoditie, or incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of the Church ſhall require. And therfore as we doe not affirme, that the maintenance of the Miniſters, muſt onelie, and neceſſarilie bee levied out of tythes, oblations, and ſuch like, ſo alſo we do not denie, but that the tenth part of the increaſe of all our goodes, by the authoritie of the King, &amp; his lawes, may be allotted for their poſſeſſion and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:177772:68"/> but that this duetie, may as chriſtianlie be performed, by the payment of the trenth part of the increaſe of our corne, hay, wooll, lambe, &amp;c. as by the eight, twelfeth, twentieth, or any other part of our money, and coyne. By payment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of which tythes, the Miniſters at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſeaſon, with everie kinde of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie proviſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towards hoſpitalitie, might thoroughlie be furniſhed, which manie times they ſhall want, by reaſon of mens backwardnes, when collections of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney are to be made. But to ſpeake no more of this matter of tythes, we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the obiection made againſt the Apoſtolicall government, drawen from taking away impropriations. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we wil not handle, whether the lawes whereby impropriations do ſtande, as mens lawfull poſſeſſion, and heritage muſt (as he ſaieth) bee taken away: but whether impropriations, now devided from the Miniſterie, and diſperſed into many ſeverall mens handes, and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to many vſes in the common weale, may not in tract of time by ſome whole ſome lawe, be reduced, eyther wholie, or in part, to be the only lawful poſſeſſions
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:177772:69"/> and inheritances for the Miniſters of the Goſpell, yea and that without any preiudice or damage vnto Prince, or people.</p>
                  <p>It is evident in the eyes of all, thatthe Churches now appropried, do ſtand &amp; remaine, as the lawfull poſſeſſions &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances, either of the King, or of the Nobles, or of the Knightes, Eſquyres, Gentlemen, and other temporall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: or of Archbb.

Wherefore to the end our meaning may the better be vnderſtood, and that wee may proceed orderlie, we think it good, to examine firſt, by how many ſeverall wayes, ſome of theſe impropriations may be wholy and thoroughly reduced: ſecondlie, by how many ſeveral meanes, other ſome in part, may be brought to the vſe of the Miniſterie. To reduce ſom of them whollie may bee done by reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, <note place="margin">Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may bee reduced to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer meanes.</note> commutation, redemption, and

And firſt that I preiudice not the Lords ſpirituall, and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of their auncient priviledges, from being placed in the firſt ranck, reaſon is, that (they teaching the people, not to poſſeſſe other mens goodes wrongfully) we ſpeake firſt of reſtitution to be made by them.

I trow, there <note place="margin">The ſtate of the Prelacie is not one of the three e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leament.</note> is none of the ſtate of Prelacie, ſo ill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, as to take vpon him the proofe of this poſition: <hi>viz.</hi> That the Lords ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall by them ſelves alone, doe make one of the three Eſtates, or that the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of England, to this day haue ſtood by their authorities, as by the authoritie of thoſe, who alone by themſelves, are to be accompted, one of the three Eſtates. For if that were ſo, how much more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, might the great Peres, Nobles, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Lords, chalenge to make by them ſelves an other eſtate?

It had not bene liegnes, nor loyaltie (I am ſure) howſoever hee ſpake much of the Lords ſpirituals duty and fidelitie in the execution of our late Queenes lawes, to haue ſet her Royall perſon, authoritie and State, behind the lobby, at the Parliament doore. Either the Kinges Royall perſon then, as not compriſed within the compaſſe, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcription of the three Eſtates, by his meaninge (which had bene but a very bad meaning) muſt be thought to haue bene hitherto ſecluded, from authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the ſtatute lawes, made in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Or it is a moſt cleare caſe, that the Lords ſpiritual them ſelves alone, do not make any one of the three Eſtates.

I thinke the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities with ſo manie places of the Realm, receiving religion, &amp; theſe other diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for it, may be counted to bee ſome part of the Clergie of the Realme. And ſo it was not receyued without conſent of the Clergie: But theſe were not of the Parleament, What then? But as <hi>Ioaſh, Ioſaphat, Ezekias,</hi> and <hi>Ioſias,</hi> did not make a new religion, but reſtored that which was defaced &amp; had long lien bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, ſo our Parleament, did not ſet forth a new religion, but reſtore that, which was godlie begane vnder the good King <hi>Edward,</hi> confirmed by the Parleament, and Clergie then, &amp;c. But nothing can be concluded, as a lawe by Parleament, (ſay they) without conſent of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie

I had rather (ſaith Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Pilkington)</hi> leaue this to bee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the Lawiers, then otherwiſe. Yet that the world may ſee, that ſome thing may be ſaide in it, we graunt him, not this to be true, that no law at all can be made without conſent of Biſhoppes.

Only theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner creepers, that dare not ſhew their face, and would deceyue the people, goe about to deface all good &amp; godly order, that diſpleaſes them. In the dayes of King <hi>Edward,</hi> they had the like fonde opinion, that the Kinge could not make lawes in his minoritie, vntill he came vnto full age, and to make the people to diſobey their Prince.

                  <p>This argument ſeemeth to be drawne from kitchin profite, and is but a bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begger to ſcarr covetous men from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their neckes vnto the yoke of that holy Diſcipline, which our Savior Chriſt hath preſcribed, and which the Admonitor himſelfe confeſſeth, to haue bene practiſed by the Apoſtles, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church. And yet becauſe this argument ſeemeth to lay a very heavie
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:177772:97"/> burden on mens ſhoulders, ſuch as is impoſſible to be borne, it is an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <note place="margin">That Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours &amp; Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons ſhould be found at the charge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pariſh is abſurd.</note> worthy to bee examined, though in it ſelfe, the ſame be very vntrue &amp; abſurd. For who did ever fancie that a Paſtour, a company of Seniours, and a Deacon, or two at the leaſt, ſhould be men of occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, or that they ſhould be all found of the pariſh, becauſe they muſt leaue their occupations, to attend vpon the matters of the Church? Why? there be many hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreths of pariſhes in England, wherein there dwelleth not one man, of an occupation. And what reaſon then or likelihood of reaſon was there, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch an abſurd neceſſitie vpon the Church? As for the neceſſitie of having one Paſtour in every particular pariſh, and of his finding by the pariſh, becauſe it is his duety, to attend vpon reading, exhortation, &amp; doctrine, although he be no man of occupation, this (I ſay) is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable &amp; conſonant, to the goverment of the church practiſed by the Biſhops. And therefore in the finding, &amp; having of one Paſtour in every pariſh, they, and we differ not. But that men of occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions onelie ſhould bee choſen Seniours
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:177772:97"/> and Deacons in every pariſh; or if Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and Deacons, were men of occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in any pariſh, that they ſhould bee all found of the pariſh, wee vtterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme as an abſurditie of abſurdities. And yet wee deny not, but in Cities and great Townes wherin for the moſt part, men of trade, do inhabite, that Seniours &amp; Deacons muſt of neceſſitie be men of occupations. Vnleſſe then an occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt of neceſſitie hinder men, from being faithfull, religious, &amp; godly men, there is no reaſon to inforce, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of occupations in Cities, and great townes, ſhould not be choſen Seniors, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons. And as for Countrey pariſhes, <note place="margin">What kinde of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to be choſen Seniours &amp; Deacons.</note> wherein either verie fewe, or no men of occupations doe reſide, this obiection is altogether idle.

And we doubt not, but all ſuch men as whom we intend, ought to bee choſen Seniours, and Deacons, whether dwelling in Cities &amp; Townes, or in the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, would be as readie, as willing, and as watchfull, prudentlie to imploy

                  <p>When the people of Iſraell were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to pay their tythes, firſt fruites, and other oblations vnto the Prieſtes &amp; Levites, for their attendance and ſervice in the Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctuarie, we doe not reade in the whole booke of God, that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to be helpers and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tributors to the reliefe and ſuſtentation of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes over thouſands, of the Captaines over hundreds, nor of the Elders &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, placed Citie by Citie, for the affaires of the King.

For they whoſe frowardnes hath bene publicke, and tending to the common offence of the Church, let ſuch be recalled to the acknowledgement of their faultes, and let them publicklie for the ſame be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that the Church by their whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome coertion, may be brought in good frame. Afterward, let the Miniſter go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apart, with ſome of the Elders, take counſell, how the others (whoſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are ſaid to be lewd, and whoſe life is ſaide to be full of miſchiefe) may firſt according to the commaundement of Chriſt in the Goſpell, come together, &amp; be communed with, by ſober and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete men, and with a certeine kinde of brotherly loue.

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:177772:100"/> ſharpe payne, which by the Goſpell wee know to bee prepared for contumacie. And when the force and vehemencie of excommunication ſhalbe ſhaken, firſt let the Biſhoppe be ſought vnto, who if he ſhall conſent, and oppoſe his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, let the forme of excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be diſpatched, before the whole church that we may bring in as much as may be the auncient Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>Thus much haue theſe moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Diſciplinarians, and renewers of the auncient Diſcipline, by Paſtours, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Deacons both written and ſpoken. And yet haue they ſounded ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a word, to the finding of Elders and Deacons by the Pariſh, nor by hauing men of occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to leaue their buſines, to attend vpon matters of the Church.

And where then is that pariſhe in Englande, that is not able to mainteyne a tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miniſter?</p>
                  <p>The next argument, that the people might not chooſe their Paſtours, Elders <note place="margin">Pag. 78.</note> and Deacons, as is required, is drawen partlie from a feare, that the ſame wilbe a matter of ſchiſme, diſcord, and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in many places: partlie from affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and want of right iudgement of the people, partlie from the vnrulines of the pariſhes, and partlie from the broyle and trouble which may follow.</p>

Eſpecially ſeeing in this place
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:177772:103"/> of the admonition we haue a playne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that the common maner of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Paſtors, Elders and Deacons in the old Churches was made by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For if the examples of ſchiſme, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord <note place="margin">Common manner of elections in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches was by the people.</note> &amp; contention, did commonly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the olde churches, while that maner of election did continue, then by his owne mouth that maner of election was common, and did continue in the olde churches. Beſides, this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (ſaith he) cauſed Princes &amp; Biſhops ſo much to entermedle in this matter. From whence it neceſſarily againe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that by the holy Scriptures, and law of God, Princes and Biſhops, did not entermedle with that matter at all. For had it bin ſimply lawful for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to haue <note place="margin">Bb. medle not with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Paſtours by the holie Scriptures.</note> dealt in thoſe cauſes by the worde of God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as well before ſchiſme, diſcord, and diſſention, as afterward, yea rather much more before then afterward. For then by their own right, might Princes and Biſhops haue prevented all occaſion of ſchiſme, and contention, and haue ſo preſerved the Church, that no tumult, or diſorder, ſhould once haue bin rayſed or begun therein. Againe if by the lawe
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:177772:104"/> of God, Princes &amp; Biſhops, had medled in theſe matters, and had not entermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by humane deviſe, then lawfully by their authoritie alone, might they haue choſen Paſtours, Elders and Deacons in the olde Churches: which thing in this place by neceſſarie inference he denieth. For ſchiſme (ſaith he) cauſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedle. So as by his confeſſion, they were but entermedlers, and entercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, by reaſon of ſchiſme, &amp; not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, and medlers by vertue of Gods word. And yet now a dayes our reverend Biſhops in this caſe, are no more enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoners, with Princes and with the people, they are no more entermedlers as in olde times they were; but they haue now ſo farre encroched vpon the prerogatiues of the Prince, and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the people, that neither Prince <note place="margin">Biſhops en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croch vpon the right of prince and people.</note> nor people, haue any commons in the election of Paſtours, Elders &amp; Deacons with them at all. Beſides if ſchiſme, and contention among the people were the reaſon, why Biſhops firſt entermedled in the choiſe of Paſtours, we now having no ſchiſme nor contention about the choiſe of Paſtours, by the people, and ſo

But this effect, is therefore ſtill to be continued, becauſe otherwiſe the cauſe would a new ſprout out, and ſpring vp againe. Nay rather inaſmuch, as for theſe many yeares, we haue had ſchiſme, diſcord &amp; diſſention, becauſe the Biſhops wholy and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue medled in the choiſe of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, and haue thruſt vpon the people, whatſoever Paſtours pleaſe not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but pleaſed themſelves, &amp; haue not ſuffered the people to medle, no not ſo much as once to entermedle in theſe matters; in as much (I ſay) as theſe things be ſo: it ſeemeth moſt expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, requiſite, &amp; neceſſarie, for the appeaſing, &amp; paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of this diſcord, &amp; the taking away of this ſchiſme, to haue that maner of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, which was in the old Churches, reſtored to the people; and this wherein the Biſhops haue entermedled, without authoritie from the worde, to be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: that ſo againe the cauſe of ſchiſme and ſtrife, which is now among vs cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the effect might likewiſe ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>After I had ended this tract, in this maner, touching this poynt, there came
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:177772:105"/> into mine handes a booke intituled <hi>The perpetuall gouernment of Chriſtes church</hi> written by <hi>Thomas Bilſon,</hi> Warden of <hi>Winchester</hi> Colledge: in the fifteenth chapter of which booke is handled this queſtion, <hi>viz:</hi> to whom the election of Biſhoppes and Preſbiters doth rightlie belong, and whether by Gods lawe the people muſt elect their Paſtours or no. In whiche Chapter alſo the matter of ſchiſme, ſtrife, and contention is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The finall ſcope and concluſion whereof, is as the propoſition impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, two fold: Firſt, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Biſhops, then concerning Paſtours. <q>The quarell taken againſt Biſhoppes doth not ſo much touch (ſayth he) the office, and functions of Biſhoppes, as it doth the Princes prerogatiue. When you rather thinke the Prince may not name her Biſhoppes without the conſent and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people, you impugne nor vs, but directlie call the Princes fact, and her lawes in queſtion.</q> As touching this poynt of the propoſition, becauſe the people by any lawe, or cuſtome; never chalenged anie right, or intereſt in the choyſe of the Kings Biſhoppes, we haue
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:177772:105"/> nothing to medle or to make about the choyſe, of any of his Kinglie Biſhoppes. <note place="margin">The Kinge only hath power without the people to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate his Kingly Bb.</note> Nay we confeſſe, as his Highnes proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitours Kings of England, haue bin the Soveraigne Donours, Founders, Lords and Avowes of all the Biſhoprickes in England without ayd of the people; that ſo likewiſe it is a right, and intereſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted into his Imperiall Crowne, that he onely, his heyres &amp; ſucceſſours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of the people, ought to haue the free nomination, appointment, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, inveſtiture, and confirmation of all Biſhoppes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in anie of thoſe Biſhoprickes; yea &amp; we ſay further, that the King alone, hath not power onely to nominate, collate &amp; confirme, but alſo to tranſlate, yea and if it pleaſe him to depoſe all his Kingly Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes without anie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at all.

And therefore our moſt humble prayer to the King is, that his Maieſtie would be pleaſed, that ſuch his Kingly Biſhops may not henceforth overcrow, and iuſtle our Gods Biſhoppes: nor haue any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie over Gods Biſhoppes.

                  <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came in the fleſh, he came to reforme the abuſe crept in of the Law, and to improue the corruptions of doctrine taught by the Scribes, Phariſies, and Doctors of the lawe, but hee tooke not away any leaſt title of the law, ne aboliſhed any iote of true, &amp; ſound doctrine in the Church.

It is free, I graunt, for a man to eate or not to eate, to drinke, or not to drink, but for a man not to eate at all, or not to drinke at all, and ſo with hunger and thirſt to ſterue him ſelfe, is not free: and in this caſe <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenti ſit iniuria.</hi> Euery man that hath a wife, that hath ſonnes and daughters, that hath men-ſervantes, and mayd-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantes; as by the verie inſtinct of nature, and by rhe equitie of the lawe of Chriſt, he hath freedome to provide for them, ſo muſt hee carefullie vſe this his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

For by thus violating the rules, and grounds, &amp; by thus treading, as it were, vnder foote, the equitie of Chriſt, and the freedome they haue by the lawe of God: ſhould they not moſt prophanelie, and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie deſpight God, and, as it were, over turne the whole order he hath ſet in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?

What then? if it doe depend, or bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned vnder the generall groundes, and rules of reaſon, nature, chriſtian equitie, chriſtian ſocietie, principles of humane fellowſhippes, the law of God, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Apoſtles, and that which was from the beginning: Is it not ſufficient? Though it bee not expreſſed in theſe termes, <hi>viz:</hi> That the people muſt choſe, or that the people haue right to chooſe their Biſhoppes? It is not expreſſed and conteyned in the ſcriptures, that everie man muſt chooſe his owne wife; or that everie woman muſt chooſe her own huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. And yet by the doctrine expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or conteyned in the ſcriptures, is it true that no man hath right either to chooſe an other mans wife, or to chooſe an other womans huſband. And that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie man hath right to choſe his owne wife, and every woman right to chooſe her owne huſbande. Againe, it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and conteyned in the ſcriptures,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:177772:110"/> that infantes muſt bee baptized: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it expreſſed and conteyned in the ſcriptures that the Biſhopp of <hi>Lichfield</hi> muſt haue but one wife. Yet becauſe it is conteyned in the ſcriptures, that God in the beginning, brought but one woman vnto one man, and gaue to one woman but one huſband.

And why? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scriptures (having put no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwene Biſhops and Paſtours) knowe no ſuch Biſhops as wee haue in <note place="margin">Biſhopps in England are only Biſhops by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings grace, &amp; not by diuine in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtitution.</note> England. And therfore Biſhops in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, being Biſhops only by the Kinges grace, and not by divine inſtitution and ordination, as Paſtours in Englande be,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:177772:110"/> hence is it, that the Kings of England, by their prerogatiue Royall, and not the people, by the rule of Scriptures, haue choſen their Biſhops in England. And for this cauſe alſo was it, that Kinge <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, with adviſe of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leament, did reaſſume, the nomination, appointment, inveſtiture, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of his Kingly Biſhops from the Pope. As for the nomination of Paſtoures, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cure of ſoules in pariſhes (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">Paſtors in parochiall Churches were neuer placed by the King; as Bb. are in their Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rickes.</note> then all patrones by right of patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, doe giue preſentmentes) their choyſe, inſtitution, tranſlation, or depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the Kings of Enland by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall power, never yet hetherto tooke the ſame vpon them. And if the Kinges of England by any fact, or by any law, did never take away the right, intereſt, and freedome from the people, in chooſing their Paſtours; what right, other, then by vſurpation, can the Biſhops haue, to impoſe, or thruſt vpon the people Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours without their liking? But by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and conſent the people haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreyned them ſelves. Herevnto (if it were not already ſufficiently anſwered, that the people could not lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreine

                     <hi>Rome</hi> neuer left curſing &amp; fighting, till they had excluded both Prince, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and reduced the electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wholy to the Clergie. By curſing, and fighting then haue the people bene overruled, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and not by cuſtome or conſent, haue they reſtreyned them ſelues. Yea &amp; by vertue of this curſed fight onely, doe the Biſhoppes of Englande at this day, exclude both Prince and people, from medling in the choyſe of Paſtoures. For by authoritie of the canon law, made by thoſe late curſing and fighting Biſhopps of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Biſhoppes of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d haue the ſole ordination, and placinge of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours over the people.

                  <p>At the humble petitions and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, of all his Lords temporall, and Commons in Parleament aſſembled, his Maieſtie would be well pleaſed, to giue his Royall aſſent to an Act: to be intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: An Act, for the reſtitution of the auncient right, and freedome which the people of God in the old Churches had, and which the people in England ought to haue, in, to, or about the election of their Paſtours, and aboliſhing all papall power repugnant to the ſame. For if (as it is plainlie confeſſed) the people of all Churches, haue right, and freedome by the law of God, by the equitie of Chriſt, by the grounds of reaſon, and nature, by the principles of humane fellowſhipps, and by that which was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to elect their Paſtours: and if alſo the ſame right, and freedome being left to the old churches, and eſpecially to the

For there can bee no ſuites, much leſſe can there bee anie partiall ſuites, when neither Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif, nor defendant may be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; where alſo there can lie no writ, nor any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be commenced. For who be the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties betweene whom theſe partiall ſuites ſhould ariſe? Be there many Miniſters, who for one place, and at one time, are
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:177772:128"/> found meete for the ſame? And do they ſue and contende one againſt another, which of them ſhould poſſeſſe the place? or ſhould theſe ſo many partiall ſuites, conſiſt betweene the inhabitants of one Pariſh; one part leaning to one ſide, and another part cleaving to the other ſide? Touching the Miniſters, we affirme that none may or ought to ſue or ſollicit any mans voyce, directly or indirectly, much leſſe to labour for a place of Miniſterie. And therefore, we deſire by an irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble law (according to the manner of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians)</hi> to haue it enacted, That as well every procurer, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer for a voyce, as alſo every ſuitor, and ſollicitor for a place of Miniſterie, bee adiudged <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> incapable for ever of the ſame place.

And in deed what advantage, or what pleaſure ſhould Ancientes divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt Ancientes, and chief men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted againſt chief men in a Pariſh, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the election of a Miniſter, reape by ſuch a diviſion, and diſtraction?

For though ſome times per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes they varie in their iudgementes one from another, yet reſt they more wiſe &amp; provident, then to empaire their owne eſtate, to advance an other mans reputation. And if in former times there hath no occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of partial ſuits (touching publike Officers in the common weale) <note place="margin">No partiall ſuites can be among pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners, when one only is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to bee choſen by them.</note> fallen out betwene the people, when out of a multitude they haue choſen one: much leſſe can there be any occaſion of partiall ſuits, if onlie there remaine but one, to be choſen to be a Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:177772:129"/> For if all the ancients agree to chuſe that one, then is all the ſuite (about him) ended: and if the greater part diſagree, yet this their diſagreement can bee no occaſion to breed and nouriſh ſuite and contention. And why? firſt becauſe no other cauſe by the greater part ought to bee alleaged, to withdraw their conſent, but only ſuch a cauſe as the law ſhould preciſely allowe, in the ſame caſe, to be a iuſt cauſe: Secondly becauſe this iuſt cauſe before the day of election, ought to be made known vnto the Magiſtrate, and by him to bee approved; ſo that if the greater parte vpon the day of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhall diſſent, not having before hande, alleaged, and provided a iuſt cauſe of their diſlike, the voyces of the leſſer part (as being ſuppoſed the better part) ſhall prevaile, confirme and make good the election. Oh! heere is much (ſaide my Lordes) ſpoken of a choiſe, &amp; election to be made by the Miniſters &amp; people, by proofes to be made before the Magiſtrate, but here is not any one word ſpoken, or any mention made of the Patrone, of the Biſhop, or of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon; of preſentation, inſtitution, or

And what an alteration, and innovation would that bee, and what a dangerous attempt were it, to alter lawes ſetled; and that Patrones ſhould be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and that Biſhops and Archdeacons ſhould not medle in theſe buſineſſes any more? Well then to wipe away as much as in me lyeth, this cavillous reproch, &amp; obloquie from the ſervants of God, who are chalenged to bee newfangled, gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die-headed, &amp; fanaticall ſpirites, ſtrange innovators, and deſirers of perilous alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: to wipe away (I ſay) this ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, If it may pleaſe the King, with his <note place="margin">The forme of Church policie now in practiſe by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, &amp; the platforme of Church po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie. deſired to bee plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> Princely wiſdome to conferre, the forme of pollicie now in vſe, and practiſe, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ordinations, preſentations, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and inductions, by Bb.

                  <p>Oh! but this were a ſtrange kinde of innovation, and a dangerous attempt to <note place="margin">To execute the premiſes no daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt.</note> alter lawes ſetled, eſpeciallie in a ſetled eſtate of the Church.

For if every place of miniſtration, be full, and none muſt be made a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, vntill ſome place be voyde, then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſome patrones, vpon good cauſes, to be allowed by publick diſcipline, might be permitted, to nominate ſome Clerkes alreadie placed in adminiſtrations: Yet in the end, as well the patrones of thoſe Churches, from whence theſe are to bee remoued, as other patrones alſo (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie benefices at one time beeing voyde) muſt of neceſſitie, ſeeke out men, to bee ordeyned, which never were ordeyned to the miniſterie before. And where are theſe to be ſought, if not onelie at the Vniverſities, or other Schooles &amp; Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of learning? For that prophetes in the ordinarie time of propheſying, ſhuld

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:177772:144"/> to barre any man from a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, whom the Governours of the Church ſhall iudge worthie to beare an office.

For if Prelacies were no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances, but only furtherances of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and learned Miniſters; and agayne, if Prelacies were no furtherances, but onlie hinderances, of vnlearned, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet miniſters, to be had in every pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, then might the great rewardes of learning, ſtill remayne, and men ſhould not be diſcouraged, to ſend their ſonnes to the ſtudie of good learning, For ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not ſo much incouraged, to ſet their ſonnes to learninge, where a few great rewardes of learning are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for a few men greatly learned, as

                           <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> as being men of ſtubbernes, then in communion, is a very groſſe, and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable errour. For we hold (as the truth is) that the greater part of the Church can not be excommunicated by the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer; nor that many ſhould be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, by a few; nor that a few ſhould be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated by one of the Church. And if the common vnion muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily conſiſt of all, or of the moſt part of the faithfull, then is the leſſer part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes out of this common vnion. For what elſe is excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but <hi>extra communionem eiectio,</hi> a caſting foorth of one, or of moe perſons from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fellowſhip, ſociety, and company of the faithfull? The greateſt part wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and not the leaſt, are accompted to be the church, and to be in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; vnleſſe then the whole church, or the greater part of the Church, having once caſt out from among them, one or moe adulterers, blaſphemers, extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, or ſuch like, and hauing alſo excommunicated men of ſtubbernes, for keeping company with ſuch, ſhall
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:177772:159"/> them ſelues all, or the greateſt part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come children of diſobedience, &amp; men of ſtubbernes: it can not bee, but there muſt be ſtill moe of the church, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, then out of communion. But if the whole Church ſhall haue caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the yoke of Diſcipline, and become ſuch them ſelues, as were thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had excommunicated, then is it a clear caſe, that there is not any more, any communion among them. For how ſhould any common vnion bee there, where is no vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at all? And if all be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from obedience, where then can the Church be? Nay further, if the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the Church ſhould revolt, &amp; forſake the faith, yet herevpon it would not follow, that moe of the faithfull, be out of communion, then in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For then ſuch onely as remayne in the vnitie of faith, and haue not ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, remayne now only to be in communion with Chriſt: out of which number alſo, if any ſhould bee excommunicated, by the reſidue of their brethren, yet even amonge this ſmall number, there would be ſtill moe in communion, then out of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:177772:159"/> For to be out of communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not be vnderſtood, to be of any but only of ſuch as remayning in the profeſſion of faith, and godlines, are yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d guiltie of ſome tranſgreſſion, and for the ſame by the Church, for a time cutt of from the Church by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of excommunication.</p>

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:177772:161"/> For of the other kind of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee neuer yet had any experience: And then by experience he could not ſpeake.

For vnleſſe theſe Officers be Chriſts Officers, the diſcipline which they vſe cannot bind the conſciences of the people of God. And for this cauſe is it very probable, that he ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth diſcipline of ſharper lawes, &amp; diſcipline
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:177772:163"/> by the Eccleſiaſticall commiſſion. For if theſe officers, by their diſcipline haue not to doe with the conſciences of men, then is it no merveyle that men feare not their diſcipline. And therefore if they wilbe ſtil officers, it is requiſite, that they call for ſuch a diſcipline, as might cauſe men to ſtand in awe of their authoritie. But were they indeed the officers of God, and had they indeede authoritie from God, to execute diſcipline by excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, as Paſtours and Elders did in the primitive Church; then were the looſenes of this age never ſo great, yet that the children of God in Englande would more feare the loſſe of goodes, landes, bodies, or lives, then the cenſure of Gods officers is one of the Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors paradoxes. And here I appeale the conſciences of all the reverend Biſhops and Prelates in the lande, and let them anſwere me hardly, if they iudge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be the children of God, &amp; had ſeven times ſeven thouſand liues, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had not rather ſeven thouſand times be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the Iaylor of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> then once be delivered over, to the Iaylor of Hell. And are not all the

And how then can they leſſe feare excommunication (which is a delivery of the ſoule to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than) then the puniſhment of body and danger of goods? And yet touching this point of excommunication, he ſeemeth <note place="margin">Admonitor ſuppoſeth it to be a fault not to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

If then excommunication bee ſo terrible to Princes and Rulers, howe ſhould it bee of ſo light accompt with ſubiects? And if it bee ſo powerfull as it can conſtraine Princes and Rulers to do their duties, how much more fearefull would it be, to compell inferiours, and men of low eſtate, to liue ſoberly in their vocations?

                  <p>Many other formes of eccleſiaſticall diſcipline of late yeares haue bene vſed by the high co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners: But whether they were all very good, and moderate diſciplines or no is greatly doubted, by many wiſe, learned, and godly men. And namely it is doubted, whether ſuch eccleſiaſticall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners as by letters patents, vnder the great Seale of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were authoriſed from the Queene, to exerciſe, vſe, occupie and execute, all

Onelie if the way hereof alreadie hath bin troden out vnto them, by ſome who <note place="margin">A caueat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchie.</note> haue not written, nor ſpoken, but yet practiſed the principles and reaſons of Oligarchie in the common weale, onelie then this I ſay, and adde as a caveat, that the daunger to come, is more heede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:177772:179"/> to be preve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. For like as in good harmonie (to make the Muſike perfaict) is required a moderate, &amp; proportionate inequalitie of voyces; which, if it too much exceed, taketh away all the ſweet melodie, ſo by too much immoderate inequalitie, or diſparitie of Citizens, the common weale falleth to ruine. But why may not the governement of the <note place="margin">The gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church by Prelacie, is not Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall.</note> Church by Prelacie, be a Princely and a Royall governement? In deed this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, if it ſhould be reſolued, by the rules and principles of the canon law, I could hardly diſproue that government to be Princelike: for, (as hath bin ſaide before) <hi>quilibet Ordinarius in ſua Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coeſi; eſt maior quolibet Principe.</hi> Yea and every Biſhop, by the ſame lawe, hath as abſolute a ſpirituall power, within his Dioceſſe, as a Kinge hath a temporall power within his Kingdome. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that law with the rules &amp; princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples thereof, is, or ought to be diſcarded out of this Kingdome, we will not wade in it. Only we ſay that the governement of the Church by Prelacie, cannot bee any kinde of Royall and Monarchicall

By what name therefore ſoever the gouvernment of Paſtours and Elders in the Churches be called, there is no manner of cauſe to diſlike of the planting of that government in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, becauſe the ſame is inſtituted by the Monarch of Monarches, who is able, and readie, to vphold the ſtate of al Monarchies in common weales, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſtate of <hi>Aristocracie</hi> in his <note place="margin">No cauſe for a Monarch to feare, that his Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſubiectes ſhould haue the ſence of Ariſtocracie in Church goverment.</note> Church.

                  </p>
                  <p>For if a people haue once ſubmitted their necks to the yoke of Chriſt, they can liue a peaceable &amp; godly life, vnder all kinds of powers, becauſe they knowe all kind of powers, to be the ordenance of God.

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:177772:181"/> any cauſe for any King, or Monarch of England, greatly (as the Admonitor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuateth) to feare, that the common people, will very eaſely transferre the principles, and reaſons of <hi>Ariſtocracie,</hi> to the gouerment of the common weale; and therevpon bee induced to thinke that they haue iniurie, if they haue not as much to doe in civill matters, as they haue in matters of the Church, ſeeing they alſo touch their commoditie and benefit temporallie, as the other doeth ſpirituallie. And certes it ſeemeth that the Admonitor was drawen very drie of reaſon, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was fayne to plucke this ſtake from the hedge, to make a fire, and to kindle the wrath of the Magiſtrate, againſt the forme of diſcipline, by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Elders.

Or how is it probable, that they would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loade them ſelues with that burthen, to eaſe the Church wherof they haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly expoſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues into a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of reproches, contempts, bytings, &amp; perſecutions? As for that other intende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Admonitors, that it is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be feared, that the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people will eaſely transferre Monarchie, vnto <hi>Democracie,</hi> or <hi>Ariſtocracie,</hi> if the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and reaſon thereof, by experience, were made familiar in their minds. this reaſon (I ſay) might ſeeme to carrie ſome ſhewe of affrighting a Monarch, if the ſame were inſinuated vnto a king, whoſe people were neuer acquainted with the principles &amp; reaſons of Democracie, or
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:177772:182"/> Ariſtocracie: but this feare being inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated vnto our late Souveraigne Ladie the Queene, whoſe people euer ſince the time they firſt bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be a people, haue had their witts long exerciſed, with the <note place="margin">The people of England haue their wits exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the ſence of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracie &amp; Ariſtocrarie</note> ſence and feeling, of the reaſons &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, aſwell of <hi>Democracie,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Ariſtocracie,</hi> what ſence had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitor to vrge this feare? That in the Kingdome of Englande, the common people haue alreadie the ſence and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the reaſons &amp; principles of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracie, cannot be denied. For in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie cauſe almoſt, aſwell of criminall, as ciuill iuſtice (ſome few only excepted) to be executed in the common weale, by the common lawes of the Realm, haue they not ſome hand, and dealing in the ſame, by one meanes or other? Nay which is more, haue they not the ſence and feeling, of the making, and vnma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their owne lawes in Parleament? And is not their conſultation in Parlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a mere Democraticall conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? As much alſo there is to bee avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, for the ſence, and feeling of the reaſons, and principles of Ariſtocracie, to be alreadie in the minds of the Peres,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:177772:182"/> the Nobles, the Iudges, and other great men of the Realme. For are not the Wiſeſt, the Nobleſt, &amp; the Chiefeſt taken out of theſe, by the King, to bee of his Counſell, and to be Iudges and Iuſticers in his Courts? Yea, and is not their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly alſo in Parleament, a mere Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocraticall aſſembly? And what tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation then is there greatly to be feared, out of the Church to bee made into the common weale, when the minds of all ſorts of our common wealthes-men, be already ſeaſoned, with the things which hee feareth? And when the common weale is alreadie ſeyſed of the principles and reaſons, which he would not haue familiarly known vnto it. Wherefore that the King, the Nobles, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons, may no more be ſcarred, with the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes of theſe vncouth, and vnknowne greeke names, of <hi>Democracie,</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracie,</hi> writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his booke with great and capitall letters; I haue thought it my duty, by theſe preſents to informe them, that the goverme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the church by Paſtors and Elders nowe wanting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, and deſired to bee brought into the Church, by the Souveraine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

And that therefore it will be a very eaſy matter, to tranſferre the ſame, to the gouerment of the Church. For by the reaſons and principles of their own gouerment, in the common weale, and by the ſence, &amp; feeling thereof, they may wel be induced, to thinke, that they haue iniurie, if they haue not as much to doe in matters of the Church, as they haue to doe in matters of the common weale, ſeeing they touch their commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie and benefitt ſpiritually, as the other doeth temporally. And withall on the other ſide, I ſhall doe my beſt indeavour, to aduertiſe them that the gouernement of the Church by Prelacie, is ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of gouernment, as was neuer yet <note place="margin">The govern<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of the Church by Prelacie, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vſed in the common weale.</note> in the adminiſtration of iuſtice by any ſubiect (no not touching the outward forme thereof) once admitted into any

And to the end, that we may clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relie diſcerne, whether the nature of the gouerment of the Church by Prelacie, or the nature of the gouerment, deſired to be planted by Paſtors and Elders, be more agreable to the nature of the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, receaued and vſed both by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and common people, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale; it is neceſſarie that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and formes, both of Prelaticall, &amp; Paſtorall gouernment, be made familiar vnto the minde of the Reader.

Wherein that we be not miſtaken, it is to be vnderſtood, that the maner of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of iuſtice, wherof we ſpeak, is that adminiſtration of iuſtice onlie, whiche reſpecteth the puniſhment of crimes ecclleſiaſticall to be inflicted by ſpirituall cenſures.

And therefore to hold vs ſtill to the point in queſtion, it is very plaine and euident, that this manner of ſpirituall Iuſtice, mentioned to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, by the Paſtors and Elders, is more correſpondent, to the adminiſtration of civill Iuſtice, in the common weale, then is that manner of the execution of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

The Steward indeed is the director, and moderator of the Court, the giuer of the charge, and the mouth of the whole aſſembly, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and enact the whole worke of their meeting, but he is not the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor, the preſentor, the informer, or the Iudge, to diſpoſe all things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne diſcretion.

Furthermore, this manner of the examination of the fact, and declaration of the law, for the triall of the fact, and iudgement of the lawe, doth not reſide in the breſt of one Iuror or Iudge alone. In the Courte of the Kings Bench, if a priſoner bee brought to the Barre, and confeſſe not the crime, <note place="margin">Iuſtice in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the B.

The ſame maner of iudgement, for the law is in vſe, and is practized by the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in the Court of common Pleas, and by the Barons of the Exchecquer in the Latin Courte of the Exchecquer.

But let it bee graunted, that <hi>Rouland Allen,</hi> denounceth the leſſon which is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the paper, for him to read; yet is it cleare by the precept, that the ſame muſt bee done, by the preſcript of Doctor <hi>Hone.</hi> Beſides Doctor <hi>Hone,</hi> he citeth; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizateth, the parties, and they being abſent, he pronounceth them <hi>contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer abſentes,</hi> and <hi>in paenam contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum ſuarum huiuſmodi,</hi> decreeth them to be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate: and are not al theſe neceſſarie partes incident to the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diſcipline by excommunication? And how then can the Miniſter, be ſaide to excommunicate alone, when Doctor <hi>Hone</hi> of neceſſitie muſt play three parts of the foure; without all, or without any
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:177772:196"/> one of which parts, the excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by reaſon of a nullitie, is merelie voide?

Furthermore to ſay that <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Allen</hi> doth excommunicate, by the authoritie of Doct. <hi>Hone,</hi> were to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe the intendement of the article: Becauſe by the ſcope of the article, it is plaine, that the Preſbyter, to be aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the officiall, muſt onlie derive his authoritie from one, who hath taken eccleſiaſticall orders. But thoſe orders Doctour <hi>Hone</hi> never tooke, otherwiſe <hi>Rouland Allens</hi> preſence, had bene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarie and ſuperfluous. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the excommunication be of any validitie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is diſcipline, by excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication in the Church of England ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, partlie by one laie Elder (as they call him) and partly by one Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Elder; wherein againe, it is worthy the obſervation, for the matter we haue in hand; that Doctor <hi>Hone,</hi> a mere laie &amp; temporall man, hath authoritie from
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:177772:197"/> the Archdeacon, to call, and aſſociate vnto him, &amp; to preſcribe <hi>Roul. Allen</hi> a Preſbiter, &amp; an other mans hireling Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in <hi>Southwark,</hi> to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, not only the Parochians, of an other Paſtors charge, but alſo any other Paſtor what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſubiect to the Archdeacons iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. And hath not the Kings High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then, as good right, as great a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, and as high a prerogative, to command Maiſter Doctor <hi>Andros,</hi> or Maiſter Doctor <hi>King,</hi> and lay Elders, by a lawfull election to be aſſociated vnto either of them to excommunicate ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their owne Pariſhioners, for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike drunkennes, or other notorious ſinnes, committed in their owne Pariſh? For if it bee lawfull, at the voice of a lay ſtranger, that an hireling and ſtipendary Curate, ſhould chaſe an other mans ſheepe out of his owne folde, how much more is it lawful, that a true ſheepherde, ſhould diſciplinate his own ſheepe, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and couchant within his owne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and within his owne fold?</p>
                  <p>Furthermore touching the admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of governing Elders, or lay Elders (as they call them) vnto the Miniſter of
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:177772:197"/> everie congregation, according to the former patterne of one lay Elder, that the ſame is not, a matter ſo ſtrange, for lay men to bee ioyned in this charge of eccleſiaſticall government, as the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites <note place="margin">Lay men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Queenes iniuuctions, to execute ſome part of diſcipline.</note> beare vs in hande to be: it ſhall not be amiſſe, to cal vnto their reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brances, one of our late Soveraigne the Queenes iniuctions, wherby certeyne lay perſons called overſeers, were commanded, to be choſen by the ordinaries, in every Pariſh for the better retayning of the people in obedience, vnto divine ſervice. In everie Pariſh (ſaith the Iniunction) three or foure diſcrete men, which tender Gods glorie, and his true religion, ſhall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, by the ordinaries, diligentlie to ſee, that all the pariſhioners duelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, vnto their Church, vpon all Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, and holie dayes and there to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, the whole time, of the godlie ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And all ſuch as ſhall be negligent, in reſorting to the Church, having no great, or vrgent cauſe of abſence, they ſhall ſtreightlie, call vpon them, and after due admonition, if they ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not, they ſhall denounce them to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Thus far the iniuction. Which, that
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:177772:198"/> it is not meant of the Church War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, appeareth by the verie next article; for vnto them, as is aſſigned an other name, ſo alſo another Office. That ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alſo, are not theſe kinde of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, is playne, in that they be neither ſo manie in number, as are here required, neither choſen by the ordinaries; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet do they admoniſh &amp; denounce, according to this article. Wherefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is meete, that the effect of this Iniunction, being religious, ſhould bee put in due execution, it ſeemeth a thing verie reaſonable, and much tending to the honour of the King, that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, vnder his letters patents would bee pleaſed, to appoint three, foure, or more diſcrete and faithfull perſons in everie Pariſh, not onely to performe the effect of this article, but alſo generallie to overſee the life and maners of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that without great &amp; vrgent cauſes they reſorte not vnto Typling-houſes, or houſes of evill note, and ſuſpected fame; and that vpon the Sabboths, they vſe no Heathniſh dauncing, about their diſguiſed May-poles: And after due ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition if they amend not, to denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:177772:198"/> them to the Paſtor of the place. For then might the Paſtor be encouraged, to giue <note place="margin">Book of the forme of ordeining Prieſtes.</note> his faithfull diligence, as at the time of his ordination, hee ſolemlie promiſeth vnto the Biſhop, alwayes to Miniſter the Doctrine and Sacramentes, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Chriſt, as the Lorde hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; by which words inſerted in the booke, there is a plaine and open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion made by al eſtates in Parleament, that Chriſte hath not onely eſtabliſhed <note place="margin">Everie Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ought to miniſter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſcipline of Chriſt in his own cure, by conſent of parleament.</note> diſcipline, but a certaine forme of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, in his Church, and that the Paſtor to whom the care, and charge is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to teach the people, ought to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the ſame diſcipline. For it had bene a verie abſurd parte for the Parlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to appoint the Biſhop, to receaue a promiſe from the Miniſter, to miniſter the diſcipline of Chriſt, if Chriſt had not inſtituted a Diſcipline; or that the ſame diſcipline, which he inſtituted, had not in their iudgements belonged vnto the Miniſter. And therefore this verie letter of the booke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vinceth the whole anſwere made vnto the abſtract, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this point to be verie erroneous, fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous and impertinent, to the point in
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:177772:199"/> queſtion; For whereas in the abſtract, it is alleaged, that the Biſhop by vertue of <note place="margin">The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe bindeth himſelfe to Miniſter the diſcipline of Chriſt.</note> the order and forme appointed, by acte of Parleament, bindeth the Miniſter, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to miniſter the diſcipline of Chriſt, within his cure, as the doctrine and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes of Chriſt, as the Lorde hath commaunded, &amp;c. herevnto firſt he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth that theſe clauſes do not diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively, <note place="margin">Pag. 55.

For the meaning of the law is plaine, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Miniſter by vertue of his promiſe made to the Biſhop, ſhall be no further bound to miniſter any Doctrine, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes or Diſcipline receaved by the Realme, vnleſſe the Realme haue recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſame, according to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.

Which commixion of divine and humane right, in the execution of the ordinances of God, can no maner of wayes be ſound, pure, and ſincere, and therefore alſo can not be pleaſing vnto God.

Beſides, the anſwer ſhould be vntrue, becauſe the Biſhoppe at the time of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration, doth not receyue anie authoritie to preache the worde, and miniſter the Sacraments; (for that authoritie was then commited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, when firſt he was ordeyned to be a preſbyter): But the authorite which he receyueth at the time of his conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to correct, and puniſh ſuch, as bee vnquiet, diſobedient, and criminous within his Dioceſſe.

<pb n="411" facs="tcp:177772:206"/> is not of divine, but of humane inſtitution.

But how doth it appeare, that the Vicar generall, <hi>Rowland Allen,</hi> or any other Preſbyter, did ever excommunicate by the power, or in the name of the Biſhoppe? For the profe hereof we ſhall not need to ſearch any other authenticall record, then the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:177772:207"/> precept, and the practiſe before intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of. For it is not ſaide in the precept, That the Preſbyter, being armed with authoritie from Chriſt, but it is ſayde, that the Preſbyter, being armed with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, from the Biſhoppe, or Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, ſhall denounce the ſentence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; the practiſe alſo of Doctor <hi>Hone,</hi> every way, confirmeth as much. For therein Doctor <hi>Hone</hi> doeth not chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge to be an officer vnto Chriſt, but he ſayeth, that he is the officiall of the venerable Archdeaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Surrey;</hi> and that Maiſter <hi>Rowland Allen</hi> Preſbyter, by vertu of his office, doth excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, the parties who obeyed not his mandates, who made not their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances before him, &amp;c.

Secondlie,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:177772:207"/> if they were immediate officers from Chriſt, that yet they haue no authoritie by the law of Chriſt, to transferre their right, or any part thereof, to an other perſon, or to depute an other perſon, in their name, or by their authoritie, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate. As for theſe words, <hi>viz: In Dei nomine, amen: nos Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes Hone,</hi> or <hi>nos Roulandus Allen, &amp;c.</hi> ſometimes vſed in their ſcedule of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is but a prophaning of the holie name of God, whereby they make them ſelues guiltie, of the taking of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name of God in vaine.

<pb n="414" facs="tcp:177772:208"/> then it followeth, that by a Paſtourall power, one Paſtour, may be a Paſtour of Paſtors, which is againſt the Scriptures, and contrarie to the brotherly &amp; fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like authoritie, which is common to all Paſtours vnder the ſunne, and betwene whom, touching their Paſtourall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, there is to this day, by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as litle ſuperioritie, and as great a paritie, as ever there was betwene Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Apoſtles; betwene Prophets, and Prophets; or betwene Evangeliſtes, and Eva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſtes; and as at this day, there is betwene Biſhops, &amp; Biſhops; betwene Archbiſhops, and Archbiſhops; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene Patriarckes, and Patriarckes: yea and as is betweene Earles and Earles, Dukes and Dukes, Kinges and Kinges, Emperours &amp; Emperours.

Marie, if they think, that only great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors be true Paſtors, &amp; that great powers ſpirituall, be only true powers ſpirituall; then let them alſo conclude, that onely great Knights be true Knights, that only great Dukes bee true Dukes, that onely great Kings be true Kings, and that only great principalities temporall, bee true principalities temporall.

                  <p>Theſe things haue we thus at large &amp; more fullie intreated of, to the end that the Kings Highnes, and his Parleament, and all ſortes of people, might well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, howe it is not altogether, an vnvſual and vnaccuſtomed thing, in the Church of England, that private &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour miniſters (as they call them) in their owne right, and in their owne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiall pariſhes, without any authoritie from the Biſhoppe, ſhould exerciſe even the higheſt cenſure of the Church. And that in ſundry places of the Realm there is no preeminence in the matter of the execution of the cenſures, attributed to

                  <p>For the avoyding therefore of ſundrie intollerable inconveniences whiche hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath enſued for want of that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, which the Law ſetled, doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able every Miniſter with, It is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, that all humane authoritie in the execution of ſpirituall cenſures, bee vtterlie taken away, and that the divine

                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the iuriſdiction of the Deane and Chapter, the papall lawe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abrogated, how the ſame may lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie now bee vſed, otherwiſe then by ſufferance and conſent of the King, and Realme, I know not. But of all ſpirituall authoritie exerciſed at this day in the Church of England, the ſame ſemeth to draw moſt neare to the ſemblance of the gouernment practiſed by the Apoſtles and primitiue Church. And might bee approued in many points, if ſo bee the Deane and Chapter, being as it were a Senate of preaching Elders, did no more commit the execution of their eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall iuriſdiction, to the wiſedome of one Vicar general, or principall official,

                  <p>As for Biſhoppes Suffraganes, in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande and in <hi>Wales,</hi> how many there may be, and what Cities and Townes, are to be taken and accepted, for their Seas, it is at large expreſſed in a ſtatute, made for the nomination of Suffraganes. By which ſtatute alſo wee are given to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that it remayneth onely in the diſpoſition, and libertie of everie Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop &amp; Biſhop within this Realm, &amp;c. to name and elect two honeſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete ſpirituall perſons, being learned, &amp; of good converſation, and them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto the Kinge by their writing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Seales, making humble requeſt to giue to one ſuch of the ſaide two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as ſhal pleaſe his Maieſtie, ſuch title, name, ſtile &amp; dignitie of Biſhop of ſuch Seas ſpecified in the ſaid act, as the Kings Highnes ſhall think moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>venient for the ſame, ſo it bee within the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, whereof the Bb. that doth name him is. Beſides after ſuch title, ſtile, and name given by the Kinge, it is ſaide that
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:177772:213"/> the King ſhall preſent, every ſuch perſon by his letters patentes, vnder his great Seale, to the Archbiſhop of the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, wherein the Towne, whereof hee hath his title, name, ſtile and dignitie of Biſhop; and that the Archbiſhop ſhall giue him all ſuch conſecrations, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and ceremonies as to the degree and office of a Biſhopps Suffragane ſhall be requiſite. It is further enacted, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that every perſon nominated, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, preſented, and conſecrated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that acte, ſhall be taken, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and reputed in all degrees &amp; places, according to the ſtile, title, name &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie, that he ſhall be preſented vnto, &amp; haue ſuch capacitie, power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, honor preeminence &amp; reputation, in as large &amp; ample maner, in &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion as by any of the ſaide Archb. or Bb. within their Dioceſſe ſhall be given to the ſaide Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragane, as to Suffraganes of this Realm hertofore, hath bin vſed &amp; accuſtomed. And that no Suffr. made &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated by vertue of this act, ſhall take or receiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maner of profits, of the places, &amp; Seas wherof they ſhall be named, nor vſe, haue

And that no ſuch Suffragane ſhall vſe any iuriſdiction ordinarie or Epiſcopall power, otherwiſe nor longer time, then ſhall be limited, by ſuch commiſſion to him giuen vpon peyne, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>From which Act, touching the vſe, &amp; exerciſe of Epiſcopall power, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures by the Suffragane, we may againe ſafely conclude, that the Epiſcopall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, graunted by the Biſhops, to be vſed by the Suffragane, is not of diuine right, and inſtitution, but only from humane deviſe and ordinance. For the Suffragan could not exerciſe any power called ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall or Epiſcopall, vnles by the Bb. he were nominated, by the King elected and preſented, by the Archb. conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and by commiſſion vnder the Bb. ſeale authorized, in what maner, and for what time he ſhould exerciſe the ſame.
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:177772:214"/> Cuſtome then being not from heauen, but from the earth; and againe the Bb. commiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> limiting the Suffraganes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated power being of man, and not of God, it followeth neceſſarilie, that, that Epiſcopall power, which the Biſhoppes vſe and exerciſe in England, can not be diuine but humane. Becauſe Epiſcopall authoritie which is diuine, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from the Royall and Souerayne authoritie of our Sauiour Chriſt, the giuer of all power vnto euerie officer within his Church, can not be transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to any other perſon, by the ſame Bb. by the King, by the bodie of the ſtate, or by cuſtome. For the Kings perſon, and bodie of the ſtate, not being made capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the holie ſcriptures, to vſe and exerciſe that Epiſcopall power which is of diuine inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, can neuer transferre the ſame to others, whereof they be the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues vncapable. And to defende that cuſtome, or any municipall lawe, ſhould transferre diuine Epiſcopal power from a divine Biſhopp to any humane officer, is more erroneous.</p>
                  <p>And from hence if the now L. Bb. of <hi>London</hi> iudge his Epiſcopall power to
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:177772:215"/> belong vnto him by divine, and that by the ſame right, he haue power, aſwell to ordeyne, depoſe, ſuſpend and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate preſbyters, as to confirme boyes, girles, yong men &amp; maydens,) there ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to bee good reaſon that the ſame Bb. ſhould make it apparantly knowne vnto the King &amp; Realm, by what power or commiſſion deſcended from heaven, hee may delegate vnder his Seale, the ſame his divine authoritie, of ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, depoſition, ſuſpenſion, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and confirmation, vnto Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour <hi>Sterne</hi> his now Suffragane of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if from the holy Scriptures, hee can produce no warrant, for the making of a delegation of any part, of that Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal power which he holdeth to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Savior Chriſt: then well may we conclude againſt the ordination, depoſition, ſuſpention, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, &amp; confirmation made by the ſame his Suffragane, that the ſame his Suffraganes ordination, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, &amp;c. is not divine. For how can an ordination, a depoſition, &amp;c. made

                  <p>When I had thus finiſhed, according to our line, that whiche I firſte vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke, againſt the Admonitors preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:177772:216"/> dangerous alterations, innovations, and inconveniences, &amp; was alſo purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to haue added that which (in myne opinion) ſeemeth to prove that, whiche the Admonitor by his opinion, denyeth; <hi>viz:</hi> that the externall goverment of the Church ſhould alwayes, and in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces bee one, when (I ſaye) I had thus purpoſed, by reaſon of ſome other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and for the time more neceſſarie occaſion, I was drive<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to alter my mind, and to ſhewe the ſame, in a place ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more convenient.</p>
                  <p>And yet in the meane whyle, it ſhall not be amiſſe, but a thing verie neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in this place, ſo to cleare the ſtate of the queſtion, betweene the Admonitor and mee, as the ſame beeing rightlie before hande vnderſtoode, there might no preiudicate opinion bee conceaved againſt the trueth.</p>
                  <p>The Admonitor againſt the not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of one forme of externall policie in all ages and ſtates of the Church of Chriſt, alleadgeth that in <hi>Denmarke,</hi> they haue Biſhoppes, both in name and in office: that in <hi>Saxony</hi> they haue Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoppes, and Biſhoppes in office, but
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:177772:217" rendition="simple:additions"/> not in name: that in <hi>Tigure,</hi> they haue no Senate of Elders; nor the diſcipline by excommunication, which they more miſlike; that in <hi>Geneua,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; in other places, they haue a gouernment not much vnlike that platforme which is deſired to be amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs: that in <hi>Saxonie,</hi> &amp; <hi>Baſill</hi> they kneele at the Lordes Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: all <hi>Tigure</hi> they ſitt, &amp; it is brought vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that in other places they go and receyue it, for the more expedition, as they paſſe. And that he doubteth not but that the learned men, whom God ſent, to inſtruct thoſe churches in which the Goſpell in thoſe dayes was firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, haue bin directed by the ſpirit of God, to reteyne this libertie, that in externall gouernment, and other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward orders, they might chooſe ſuch, as they thought in wiſedom, and godlines, to bee moſt convenient, for the ſtate of their countrey and diſpoſition of the people.</p>
                  <p>Vnto all which we anſwere briefelie; <hi>viz.</hi> that Biſhoppes both in name and in office beeing of diuine inſtitution, ought aſwell to bee in the Church of England as of <hi>Denmark.</hi> that it is an
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:177772:217" rendition="simple:additions"/> errour (by their leaue) in the Church of <hi>Saxony,</hi> not to haue Archb. and Bb. in name, if ſo be they hold it lawful to haue Archb. and Biſhops in office. For what ſhould a neceſſarie officer doe, without a conuenient name? And touching the Church of <hi>Tigure,</hi> it is not materiall, what the ſame church doth thinke not tolerable, or doth more miſlike, but what ſhee ought not to miſlike, or what it ought not to think tollerable. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what a poore proofe is there here made (trowe we) for the confirmation of the corruptions in the Church of England, by producing for two witneſſes, two er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roures in the Church of <hi>Tigure.</hi> For not to like a Senate of Elders, and more to miſlike excommunication, is more and more to ſlide out of the right way.</p>
                  <p>And ſithence we haue the whole chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kingdome of Scotland, the moſt famous, and renowmed Church of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,</hi> and ſundrie Churches, by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in other places, to be lights vnto vs, and to agree with vs, in a gouerment not much vnlike to that, which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: wee haue not only great cauſe, to reioyce in this our deſires, but alſo to be
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:177772:218"/> much comforted and encouraged, by theſe examples, by all holie meanes, to labour the full accompliſhment thereof. For by this teſtimony, &amp; by theſe inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces giuen &amp; produced by him ſelfe, the Admonitor hath quite and cleane wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, and diſabled, his owne generall poſition, opinion, and thoughts of the vnneceſſaries, and inconvenientnes, of hauing the Apoſtolicall and primitiue gouernment, in the time of peace, vnder a Chriſtian Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>For hath not the free Kingdome of Scotland, the free Citie of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and other Soueraigne and free Princes, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates and Powers, (not being vnder Tyrantes, and perſecution) receaved the ſame, as being the beſt, the fitteſt, the convenienteſt, &amp; moſt neceſſarie gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (yea even in the time of peace and vnder their chriſtian Magiſtracie) for the ſtate of their countrey, and diſpoſition of their people?</p>
                  <p>And as touching rites &amp; ceremonies, we affirme not, that every rite, ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie or circumſtance to be vſed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall execution of church goverment, is preciſelie ſett down in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:177772:218"/> but touching the ſubſtance of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment, thus we ſay, and thus we hold: <hi>viz.</hi> that the Officers and Governours appointed by our Saviour Chriſt, to bee over the Churches in everie Countrey (obſerving the generall rules of decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, comelines, and edification) haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, with the conſent of their Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King, or other ſupreame Magiſtrate, to chooſe what rites &amp; ceremonies, they in wiſedome and godlines ſhall thinke moſt convenient. And therefore wee graunt that the officers of Chriſt, in the vſe and diſpenſation of their functions, are no more exactlie tyed, by any direct commandement in the holy Scriptures, to vſe at all times, and in all places, one only maner of rites &amp; ceremonies, then were the Prieſts of the law, to vſe all one maner of kniues, to kill their ſacrifices, or the ſingers to ſing all ſonges after one maner of tune, or vpon one kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument: or then are Kinges &amp; Princes in all Countreys commanded, to vſe all kind of circumſtances, in the outward execution of civill iuſtice in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales.</p>
                  <p>As then, as it was lawful for the Prieſts
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:177772:219"/> to haue kniues and trumpets of divers faſhions; and for the Levites to haue their Muſicall inſtrumentes of divers formes: Nay as ſundrie Iuſtices of peace, in ſundrie Shires of the Kingdome, are not bound to keepe their quarter ſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all in one day to begin, &amp; to breake their ſeſſions at one inſtant; to ſtande, to ſit, &amp; to walke, when ſoever they ſpeake, to weare all one faſhion, hates, cappes, cloakes, or gownes, and ſuch like: ſo likewiſe, is it with the Biſhops, Paſtoures and Elders of the church.</p>
                  <p>In the miniſtration of Baptiſme, there is no direct co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandment, that the veſſel to hold the water, for the childes Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, ſhould be of ſtone, of pewter, of braſſe, or of ſilver; whether the Miniſter ſhould deſcend to the lower ende, or the childe aſcend to the vpper end of the church: Whether the child ſhould haue a great handfull, or a litle ſponefull of water powred vpon his head. In the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Lordes Supper, it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectlie commaunded, that the people ſhal ſtand, ſit, or paſſe: whether it ſhould be celebrated every firſt or ſecond Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both of the moneth; whether in the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:177772:219"/> morning; at noone, or at night. In the ordination of Miniſters, there is no iuſt proofe to bee made, that any certeyne number of Miniſters, are to lay on their hands, that the day of ordination ſhould be alwayes one: that the Miniſter ſhould bee of ſuch an age, or that the prayers ſhould bee of this or of that lenght and forme of wordes. And therefore touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe and ſuch like thinges of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencie, we agree with the Admonitor and reverend Bb. that one forme of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall orders, rites &amp; ceremonies is not of neceſſitie, to be in every Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no ſuch order witneſſed by the holy Scriptures to bee of neceſſitie. But touching the ioynt, &amp; ſeverall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Biſhops, Paſtours, and Elders, that they, or any of them, ſhould in any age or ſtate of the church of Chriſt bee wanting, or that ſuch offices as by war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Scripture are coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould be ſevered, or that any other perſons ſhould be appointed, to execute any functions in the Church, then ſuch perſons only, as for their functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, haue warrant from the holy Scriptures, wee can not in any ſorte therevnto agree.
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:177772:220"/> And why? forſooth becauſe all, both of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and officers in the Church, muſt only, and alonely, be derived from our Saviour Chriſt, as from the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and beſtower of all officers, &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the houſe of God. And therefore, albeit we ſhould graunt, (as the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor hath ſaide) that the outward order vſed in the primitiue Church, touching rites &amp; ceremonies, by Biſhops, Paſtors and Elders, is neither neceſſarie, nor ſo convenient as it may be otherwiſe, in the time of peace, &amp; vnder a Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, yet we may not herevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imply, as his negatiue implieth: <hi>viz.</hi> that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Paſtors &amp; Elders, or any of them, are neither neceſſary, nor ſo convenient officers, or governours, as other officers of mans invention might be. For which our opinion (by the helpe of God) wee ſhall aſſay (as before hath bene mencio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) in an other place, to lay down, out of the worde of God, ſome iuſt proofes, (according to the Admonitors requeſt) that there ought to be in all ages and ſtates of the Church, this outwarde or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; forme of goverment: <hi>viz.</hi> that Biſhoppes, Paſtours and Elders, ought
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:177772:220"/> evermore to bee ſpirituall governours, and that evermore they, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ought to vſe that eſſentiall kind of ſpirituall goverment, and none other which was practiſed by the Biſhoppes, Paſtours and Elders, in the Apoſtolicall and primitiue Church. Allwayes lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the outward rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of their ſpirituall kind of goverment, to be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, as erſt hath bene ſaid.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the end I may enform your Lord ſhippe of my dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in this Parlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-time, againſt the vndue claimed ſuperioritie of the Biſhoppes ouer their inferior brethren, Thus it was:</p>
            <p>Becauſe I was in the Parleament time, in the 25. yere of King HENRY the eight. In which time, Firſt, all the Clergie, aſwell Biſhops as others, made an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blie ſubmiſſion to King HENRIE the 8. acknowledging his Supremacie, and deteſting the vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Bb. of Romes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſubmiſſion of the Clergie, the King gaue vnto the ſaid Bb. the ſame ample rule, that before
<pb facs="tcp:177772:222" rendition="simple:additions"/> they had vnder the Pope, ouer their inferior brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; ſaving that the ſame rule was abridged by ſtatute by this parentheſis following, that is to ſay (without offending the prerogatiue Royal of the Crown of England, &amp; the lawes &amp; cuſtomes of the Realm) In the latter end of the Statute, it was added, that whoſoeuer offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in any one parte of that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, &amp; their Aydors, Counſellers, and Abbetters, they did all fall into the penaltie of the premunire. And after I had recited this ſtatute in the Parleame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t-houſe, I declared that in King HENRIES the eight days after this: There was no Biſhoppe that did practiſe ſuperioritie ouer their inferiour brethren. And in King EDWARDES dayes, the ſaid Bb. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned a ſtatute, wherby they were authoriſed to keepe their Courts in the Kings name: the which ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was repealed in Queene <hi>Maries</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:177772:222"/> dayes, and was not revived in her Majeſties time that now is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon it was doubtfull to mee, by what authoritie the Biſhoppes doe keepe their Courts nowe in their own names, becauſe it is againſt the prerogatiue Royall of the Crowne of England, that any ſhould keepe a Court, without ſufficient warrant from the Crowne. Wherevpon I was anſwered, that the Biſhopps do keepe their Courts now by preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, &amp; it is true that the Bb. may preſcribe, that King HENRY the 8. gaue them authoritie, by the ſtatute of 25. of his raigne, to haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and rule ouer their inferiour brethren, as ample as they had in the Popes time. But this was no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall warrant for them to keep their Courts by, and that in their owne names. And yet they haue none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to keep their Courts (as they do now in their owne names)
<pb facs="tcp:177772:223"/> to my knowledge. And this was the cauſe that made them obtaine a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in King EDWARDS dayes, to keepe their Courts by, in the Kings name. Now, it is a ſtrange allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Biſhopps ſhould claime authoritie at this preſent to keepe their Courtes in their owne names, (as they do) by preſcription, becauſe the ſtatute of 25. doth reſtraine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> generallie from offending of the prerogatiue Royall of the Crowne of Englande, and the lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the Realm. And no man may iuſtly keepe a Court without a ſpeciall warrant from the Crowne of England, as is aforeſaid. And the generall libertie given by King H. the 8. to the Biſhops to rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, as they did in the Popes time, is no ſufficient warrant to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to keepe their owne Courtes in their owne names by preſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as I take it. And therefore the Biſhops
<pb facs="tcp:177772:223"/> had done wiſely, if they had ſought a warrant by ſtatute to keepe their Courts in the Queenes name, as the Bb. did in Kinge EDWARDS dayes: In which time Archbiſhop <hi>Crammer</hi> did cauſe <hi>Peter Martir</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> to come over into this Realme to bee placed in the two Vniverſities, for the better inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Vniverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the worde of God. And Bb. <hi>Crammer</hi> did humblie prefer theſe learned men without any challenge to him ſelfe of any ſuperiour rule in this behalfe over his inferiour bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. And the time hath bin, that no man could carry away any grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Crown of England by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral words, but that he muſt haue ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall wordes to carrie the ſame by: Therfore how the Bb. are warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to carry away the keeping of their Courts in their own names, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: it paſſeth my vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding.</p>
            <p>Moreover, where as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb facs="tcp:177772:224"/> ſaid vnto me, that the Biſhopps haue forſaken their claime of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie over their inferiour brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (latelie) to bee by Gods ordinance, and that now they doe only claime ſuperioritie from her Majeſties ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme goverment: If this be true, then is it requiſite &amp; neceſſarie, that my L. of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> that now is, do recant and retract his ſaying in his booke of the great volume againſt <hi>Cartwright,</hi> where he ſaith in plaine wordes (by the name of Doctour <hi>Whitgift)</hi> that the ſuperioritie of Bb. is Gods owne inſtitution: Which ſaying doth impugne her Majeſties ſupreme goverme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t directlie, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to be retracted plainly and truly. For Chriſt plainly &amp; truly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, Ioh. 18. 36. <hi>That his Kingdom was not of this world.</hi> And therfore he gaue no worldly rule or prohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence to his Apoſtles, but the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly rule which was to preach the
<pb facs="tcp:177772:224"/> Goſpel, ſaying: <hi>Ite, predicate in omnem mundu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quicu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>que crediderit &amp; baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus fuerit, ſalvus erit: qui non crediderit, condemnabitur. Goe &amp; preach in all the world, who ſoever ſhall beleeue &amp; be Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, ſhalbe ſaved: but he that will not beleeue, ſhalbe condemned, Mark 16. 15.</hi> But the Biſhops do cry out, ſaying, that <hi>Cartwright</hi> &amp; his fellows, would haue no goverment, &amp;c. So, belike, the Bb. care for no goverme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but for wordly &amp; forcible goverment over their brethren, the which Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gaue to his Diſciples nor Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but made them ſubiect to the rule of Princes, who ought not to be reſiſted, ſaving that they might aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer vnto Princes, that they muſt rather obey God then men (Acts. 5. 29.) and yet in no wiſe to reſiſt the Prince, but to take vp the croſſe, and follow Chriſt.</p>
